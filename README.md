Diabetes Prediction
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on various health parameters. The dataset used in this project contains medical data such as glucose levels, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and other relevant features.

Introduction
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and diagnosis can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with diabetes. This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the presence of diabetes, helping healthcare providers to diagnose the disease early and provide timely intervention.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains medical data for 768 female patients, including attributes like:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) indicating if the patient tested positive for diabetes
Installation
To run this project, you will need to have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
cd diabetes-prediction
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To train and evaluate the model, you can run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
This will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance. You can also use the Jupyter Notebook provided (diabetes_prediction.ipynb) to interactively explore the dataset and experiment with different models.

Model
The model used for predicting diabetes is a Logistic Regression classifier. Other models like Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) were also tested. The final model was selected based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Preprocessing
Before training, the dataset was preprocessed as follows:

Handling missing values
Feature scaling using StandardScaler
Splitting the data into training and testing sets (80-20 split)
Training
The logistic regression model was trained on the training set with a grid search for hyperparameter tuning.

Results
The final model achieved the following performance on the test set:

Accuracy: 78%
Precision: 76%
Recall: 74%
F1-Score: 75%
A detailed analysis of the model performance and feature importance is provided in the results file.
